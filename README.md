Running the code:
	Open the solution.py file in VS Code and run it.
	The results will be written on the terminal, and the plots will pop up after each other, you need to close them to get the new one.

    If you decide to use the solution.ipynb file, the results will be shown in the notebook. In this case the 3D graphs cannot be rotated.

    Generating the 3D map can take a bit based on the speed of your computer, be patient.
